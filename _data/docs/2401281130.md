# Proposition

A proposition is a declarative statement which is either **true** or **false**. For example, considering the statement: _New Delhi is the capital of India_, is a proposition. On the other hand, considering: $x+2=10$, is not a proposition because the value of $x$ is unknown, therefore, cannot be stated whether, it is true or false.

# Propositional Operators

## Negation

Representation: $\sim,\lnot$

If $p$ is the proposition, then the negation of $p$ is denoted by $\sim p$, and it simply reverses the truth value of $p$.

E.g.:

$p:\textnormal{It is cold today}
$

$\sim p:\textnormal{It is not cold today}$

#### Truth table:

| $p$ | $\sim p$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |

## Conjugation

Representation: $\wedge$

For any two proposition, $p$ and $q$, the conjunction is denoted by $p\wedge q$, and it gives the true value when both $p$ and $q$ are true.

E.g.:

$p:\textnormal{It is cold today}$

$q:\textnormal{It is Friday}$

$p\wedge q:\textnormal{It is cold today and it is Friday}$

#### Truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\wedge q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T           |
| T   | F   | F           |
| F   | T   | F           |
| F   | F   | F           |

## Disjunction

Representation: $\vee$

For any two proposition $p$, and $q$, the disjunction is denoted by $p\vee q$, and gives the true value if either of them or both are true.

E.g.:

$p:\textnormal{It is cold today}$

$q:\textnormal{It is Friday}$

$p\vee q:\textnormal{Either it is cold today or it is Friday}$

#### Truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\vee q$ |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | T         |
| F   | T   | T         |
| F   | F   | F         |

## Implication

Representation: $\to$

For any two proposition $p$ and $q$, the statement if $p$ then $q$ is called an implication and it is denoted by $p\to q$. It gives false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false, otherwise it is true.

E.g.:

$p:\textnormal{It is cold today}$

$q:\textnormal{It is Friday}$

$p\to q:\textnormal{If it is cold today then it is Friday}$

#### Truth table

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\to q$ |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| T   | T   | T        |
| T   | F   | F        |
| F   | T   | T        |
| F   | F   | T        |

## Bi

Representation: $\leftrightarrow$

For any two proposition $p$ and $q$, the statement $p$, _iff._, $q$ is called biconditional, and is denoted by $p\leftrightarrow q$. It gives true value when both $p$ and $q$ have the same value.

E.g.:

$q:\textnormal{It is cold today}$

$q:\textnormal{It is Friday}$

$p\leftrightarrow q:\textnormal{It is cold today iff. it is Friday}$

#### Truth table

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\leftrightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- | -------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                    |
| T   | F   | F                    |
| F   | T   | F                    |
| F   | F   | T                    |

#### Example 1: Express the following statement in propositional logic:

$$
\textnormal{It is Saturday and I am not going to college}
$$

Solution:

$p:\textnormal{It is Saturday}$

$q:\textnormal{I am going to college}$

Well formed formula (WFF): $p\wedge\sim q$

#### Example 2: Express the following statement in propositional logic:

$$
\textnormal{Either it is hot today or I am at home}
$$

Solution:

$p:\textnormal{It is hot today}$

$q:\textnormal{I am at home}$

Well formed formula (WFF): $p\vee q$

#### Example 3: Express the following statement in propositional logic:

$$
3+4\ne6\textnormal{ and C.S. class will not be held}
$$

Solution:

$p:3+4=6$

$q:\textnormal{C.S. class will be held}$

Well formed formula (WFF): $\sim p\wedge\sim q$

#### Example 4: Draw the truth table for $(\sim p\wedge q)\wedge \sim r$.

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | $\sim p\wedge q$ | $(\sim p\wedge q)\wedge \sim r)$ |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T   | F                | F                                |
| T   | T   | F   | F                | F                                |
| T   | F   | T   | F                | F                                |
| T   | F   | F   | F                | F                                |
| F   | T   | T   | T                | F                                |
| F   | T   | F   | T                | T                                |
| F   | F   | T   | F                | F                                |
| F   | F   | F   | F                | F                                |

#### Example 5: Check the equivalence for the following:

$$
p\to(q\to r)\cong(p\wedge q)\to r
$$

Solution:

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | $q\to r$ | $p\to(q\to r)$ | $p\wedge q$ | $(p\wedge q)\to r$ |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| T   | T   | T   | T        | T              | T           | T                  |
| T   | T   | F   | F        | F              | T           | F                  |
| T   | F   | T   | T        | T              | F           | T                  |
| T   | F   | F   | T        | T              | F           | T                  |
| F   | T   | T   | T        | T              | F           | T                  |
| F   | T   | F   | F        | T              | F           | T                  |
| F   | F   | T   | T        | T              | F           | T                  |
| F   | F   | F   | T        | T              | F           | T                  |

From the truth table, it can be concluded that:

$$
p\to(q\to r)\cong(p\wedge q)\to r
$$
