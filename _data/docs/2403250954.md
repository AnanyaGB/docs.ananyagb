Arithmetic circuits are used to perform several different arithmetic operations using a single composite circuit. Half adder, subtractors _etc_., are examples of **arithmetic circuits**.

# Half Adder

**Half adder** is an arithmetic circuit that performs arithmetic addition of two binary digits. Following is the details of a half adder.

### Truth table

| A   | B   | S   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |

### Circuit diagram

![Circuit diagram of a half adder](/_data/2403250954-2.png)

### Working

- It has two inputs $A$ and $B$, and two outputs sum $S$, and carry $C$.

- The sum is derived with `XOR` operation on the inputs:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
      S&=A\oplus B\\
      &=\bar{A}B+A\bar{B}
  \end{align*}
  $$

- The carry is generated by `AND` operation on the inputs:
  $$
      C=A.B
  $$

# Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic sum of three input bits, $\{A,B,C\}$ and produces a sum $S$ and carry $C$.

### Truth table

| A   | B   | C   | S   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Circuit diagram

![Circuit diagram of a full adder](/_data/2403250954-4.png)

### Working

- It consists of three inputs denoted by $A$ (augend bit), and $B$ (addend bit), and third input $C$, which represents the carry from the previous lower significant bit.

- It produces two outputs sum $S$, and carry $C$.

- From the above truth table using S.O.P. (_sum of products_), the formula of sum is derived as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S&=\bar{A}\bar{B}C+\bar{A}B\bar{C}+A\bar{B}\bar{C}+ABC\\
    &=\bar{A}(\bar{B}C+B\bar{C})+A(\bar{B}\bar{C}+BC)\\
    &=\bar{A}(B\oplus C)+A(\overline{B\oplus C})\\
    &=A\oplus B\oplus C
\end{align*}
$$

- From the above truth table using S.O.P. the formula of carry is:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S&=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB\bar{C}+ABC\\
    &=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB(\bar{C}+C)\\
    &=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB&&[\because\bar{x}+x=1]\\
    &=B(\bar{A}C+A)+A\bar{B}C\\
    &=BC+A(B+\bar{B}C)&&[\because\bar{x}y+x=y+x]\\
    &=AB+BC+AC
\end{align*}
$$

# 4-bit Parallel Adder

This circuit is capable of adding two 4-bit binary numbers resulting in four bit sum and a carry.

### Construction

**Binary bits**:

![Four binary bits in binary addition](/_data/2403250954-5.png)

**Design**:

![Four binary bits adder construction](/_data/2403250954-6.png)

- Two 4-bit binary numbers are in storage $A$ and $B$.
- Four full adders are used.
- The $C_{in}$ input is always 0.
- $A_i$ and $B_i$ and carry from the significant bit is fed as input to produce sum $S_i$ and the carry generated is forwarded to the next full adder.
- $C_{\textnormal{out}}$ is the final carry

### Working

- In least significant bit, $A_0$, $B_0$, and $C_{\textnormal{in}}$ (which is 0) are added to produce sum $S_0$ and carry $C_0$.
- Similarly all the other inputs are added in respective full adders.
- If no carry is generated 0 is forwarded.
- In case a fifth bit is generated in the final sum it is produced through $C_{\textnormal{out}}$.

# 4-bit Combined Paraller Adder/Subtractor

The **4-bit parallel adder/subtractor** circuit is capable of performing both addition and subtraction on two binary numbers.

### Construction

![Four binary bits adder/subtractor construction](/public/_data/2403250954-7.png)

- Two 4-bit numbers are stored in storage $A$ and $B$.
- $A_i$ bits are fed into the full adders directly.
- The $B_i$ inputs are fed via `XOR` gates.
- The other input of `XOR` gate are kept common and connected to the input of first full adder known as **mode**.

### Working

When mode is 0, we can understand the working if we concentrate on the first full adder, the inputs are:

$$
\begin{align*}
  &A_0+(B_0\oplus0)+0\\
  =\ &A_0+B_0&&[\because B_0 \oplus 0 =B_0]
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the circuit acts as an adder circuit.

But when mode is 1, the inputs are:

$$
\begin{align*}
  &A_0+(\overline{B_0}\oplus1)\\
  =\ &A_0+B_0&&[\because \overline{B_0}\oplus1=\overline{B_0}]\\
  =\ &A_0+(\textnormal{2's compliment of }B_0)\\
  =\ &A_0+(-B_0)\\
  =\ &A_0-B_0
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the circuit acts as a subtractor.

# Half Subtractor

A half subtractor is an arithmatic circuit used to subtract two binary digits. It takes in two inputs $A$ and $B$, and returns two outputs: difference ($D$), and borrow ($B_0$).

### Block diagram

![Half subtractor block diagram](/public/_data/2403250954-8.png)

### Truth table

| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $B_0$ |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0     |

### Circuit diagram

![Half subtractor circuit diagram](/public/_data/2403250954-9.png)

### Construction

- Two inputs $A$ and $B$ are passed directly into the `XOR` gate which gives the difference $D$.
- The inputs from $A$ is first passed into the `NOT` gate then along with $B$ is passed into the `AND` gate giving the borrow $B_0$.

### Working

- The formula for the difference can be brought out using the truth table:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
    D&=\bar{A}B+A\bar{B}\\
    &=A\oplus B
  \end{align*}
  $$

  The above is a formula of a `XOR` gate.

- The formula for borrow can be brought out using truth table as:
  $$
    \begin{align*}
      B_0=\bar{A}B
    \end{align*}
  $$

# Full Subtractor

A full subtractor accepts three input lines of binary digits and returns their difference and respective borrows.

### Block diagram

![Full subtractor block diagram](/public/_data/2403250954-10.png)

### Truth table

| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $D$ | $B_0$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1     |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1     |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1     |

### Circuit diagram

![Circuit diagram for full subtractor](/public/_data/2403250954-12.png)

### Construction

- There are three input lines, which are passed directly into the `XOR` gate, which gives us the difference $D$.
- And two consequetive lines from three input with each combination with a `NOT` gate through $A$, and noral lines through others are passed into respective `AND` gates to form, $\bar{A}B$, $\bar{A}C$, and $BC$ combinations.
- Finally the three combinations are passed into an `OR` gate to get the final borrow $B_0$

### Working

- Using S.O.P., we can find the formula for difference from the truth table as:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
    D&=\bar{A}\bar{B}C+\bar{A}B\bar{C}+A\bar{B}\bar{C}+ABC\\
    &=\bar{A}(\bar{B}C+B\bar{C})+A(\bar{B}\bar{C}+BC)\\
    &=\bar{A}(B\oplus C)+A(\overline{B\oplus C})&&[\because \bar{x}y+x\bar{y}=x\oplus y\textnormal{ and, }\bar{x}\bar{y}+xy=\overline{x\oplus y}]\\
    &=A\oplus B\oplus C&&[\because \bar{x}y+x\bar{y}=x\oplus y]
  \end{align*}
  $$

  Therefore, the result is that of a `XOR` gate

- Using K-map, the formula for borrow can be brought out as:

  ![K-map for borrow of full subtractor](/public/_data/2403250954-11.png)

  From the blue region, we have $\bar{A}C$ as common, from yellow region, we have $\bar{A}B$ as common, and from the green region we have, $BC$ common.

  $$
  \begin{align*}
    B_0&=\bar{A}B+BC+\bar{A}C
  \end{align*}
  $$
