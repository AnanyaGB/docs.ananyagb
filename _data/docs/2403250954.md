Arithmetic circuits are used to perform several different arithmetic operations using a single composite circuit. Half adder, subtractors _etc_., are examples of **arithmetic circuits**.

# Half Adder

**Half adder** is an arithmetic circuit that performs arithmetic addition of two binary digits. Following is the details of a half adder.

### Truth table

| A   | B   | S   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |

### Circuit diagram

### Working

- It has two inputs $A$ and $B$, and two outputs sum $S$, and carry $C$.

- The sum is derived with `XOR` operation on the inputs:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
      S&=A\oplus B\\
      &=\bar{A}B+A\bar{B}
  \end{align*}
  $$

- The carry is generated by `AND` operation on the inputs:
  $$
      C=A.B
  $$

# Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic sum of three input bits, $\{A,B,C\}$ and produces a sum $S$ and carry $C$.

### Truth table

| A   | B   | C   | S   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Circuit diagram

### Working

- It consists of three inputs denoted by $A$ (augend bit), and $B$ (addend bit), and third input $C$, which represents the carry from the previous lower significant bit.

- It produces two outputs sum $S$, and carry $C$.

- From the above truth table using S.O.P. (_sum of products_), the formula of sum is derived as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S&=\bar{A}\bar{B}C+\bar{A}B\bar{C}+A\bar{B}\bar{C}+ABC\\
    &=\bar{A}(\bar{B}C+B\bar{C})+A(\bar{B}\bar{C}+BC)\\
    &=\bar{A}(B\oplus C)+A(\overline{B\oplus C})\\
    &=A\oplus B\oplus C
\end{align*}
$$

- From the above truth table using S.O.P. the formula of carry is:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S&=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB\bar{C}+ABC\\
    &=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB(\bar{C}+C)\\
    &=\bar{A}BC+A\bar{B}C+AB&&[\because\bar{x}+x=1]\\
    &=B(\bar{A}C+A)+A\bar{B}C\\
    &=BC+A(B+\bar{B}C)&&[\because\bar{x}y+x=y+x]\\
    &=AB+BC+AC
\end{align*}
$$

# 4-bit Parallel Adder

This circuit is capable of adding two 4-bit binary numbers resulting in four bit sum and a carry.

### Construction

**Binary bits**:

![Four binary bits in binary addition](/_data/2403250954-5.png)

**Design**:

![Four binary bits adder construction](/_data/2403250954-6.png)

- Two 4-bit binary numbers are in storage $A$ and $B$.
- Four full adders are used.
- The $C_{in}$ input is always 0.
- $A_i$ and $B_i$ and carry from the significant bit is fed as input to produce sum $S_i$ and the carry generated is forwarded to the next full adder.
- $C_{\textnormal{out}}$ is the final carry

### Working

- In least significant bit, $A_0$, $B_0$, and $C_{\textnormal{in}}$ (which is 0) are added to produce sum $S_0$ and carry $C_0$.
- Similarly all the other inputs are added in respective full adders.
- If no carry is generated 0 is forwarded.
- In case a fifth bit is generated in the final sum it is produced through $C_{\textnormal{out}}$.
