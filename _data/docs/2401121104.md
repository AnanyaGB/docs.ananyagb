# Set

A set is a collection of objects. Each such objects are known as set elements.

E.g.: A set of **vowels** represented as:-

$$
A=\{a,e,i,o,u\}
$$

E.g.: A set of **positive integers** represented as:-

$$
A=\{0,1,2,3,...\}
$$

# Set Notation

There are two kinds of set notations:-

1. Tabular method
2. Set builder method

## Tabular method

When the set is written with the actual data of elements, the form is said to be tabular.

E.g.: A set of positive integers:-

$$
  A=\{0,1,2,3,...\}
$$

## Set builder method

When the set is written in a generalized way, which denotes all available set elements within it, the form is said to be set builder.

E.g.: A set of positive integers:-

$$
A=\{x|x\geq0,x\in{Z}\}=\{x|x\in{Z^+}\}
$$

E.g. A set of numbers divisible by 5:-

$$
A=\{x|x\textnormal{ MOD }5=0,x\in{Z^+}\}
$$

#### Example 1: Write a set of letters of the word $GOOGLE$ in both set builder and tabular form.

In tabular form:-

$$
A=\{G,O,L,E\}
$$

In set builder form:-

$$
A=\{x|x\in{A}\}=\{x|x\in\{G,O,L,E\}\}
$$

#### Example 2: Write the set $B=\{x|x\in{Z^+},z\leq9\}$ in tabular form.

In tabular form:-

$$
B=\{0,1,2,3...9\}
$$

# Subset

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. If every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, then $A$ is a subset of $B$, and is written as $A\subseteq{B}$.

E.g.: Consider the following two sets $A$ and $B$:-

$$
A=\{2,3,4\}
$$

$$
B=\{1,2,3,4\}
$$

Since, all elements of $A$ are in $B$, therefore $A\subseteq{B}$.

> A set is also its own subset.

# Power Set

Let $A$ be a set containing $n$ elements. The set of all subsets of $A$ is called the power set of $A$. It consists of $2^n$ elements. It power set of set $A$ is denoted as:-

$$
\mathcal{P}(A)
$$

E.g.: Considering the set $A=\{a,b,c\}$, then its powerset will be:-

$$
\mathcal{P}(A)=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{a,c\},\{a,b,c\},\{\phi\}\}
$$

> Null set $\phi$ is a subset of every set.

The following relations between numbers always hold true:-

$$
N\subseteq{Z}\subseteq{R}
$$

where,

- $N$: natural numbers
- $Z$: integer numbers
- $R$: real numbers

# Compliment of a Set

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. The set consisting of all elements of $B$, which are not in $A$, is called compliment of $B$, and is denoted as $B-A$.

Considering the following sets as an example:-

$$
B=\{5,9,8,12,15\}
$$

$$
A=\{9,8,11,15\}
$$

Then, the compliment of $B$ would be:-

$$
B-A=\{5,12\}
$$

# Basic Operations on Sets

Following are the operations on sets:-

1. Union
2. Intersection
3. Symmetric difference

## Union

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. The set consists of all elements of $A$ or $B$ or both, is called the union of $A$ and $B$. It is written as $A\cup{B}$.

_Figure 1: Venn diagram for $A\cup B$:_

![Figure 1: Venn diagram for $A\cup B$](/_data/2401121104-1.png)

E.g.: Considering two sets: $B=\{5,9,8\}$ and, $A=\{1,5,9,3\}$. Their union would be:

$$
A\cup{B}=\{1,3,5,8,9\}
$$

## Intersection

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. The set elements which are both in $A$ and $B$ defines the intersection of $A$ and $B$. It is written as $A\cup B$.

_Figure 2: Venn diagram for $A\cap B$:_

![Figure 2: Venn diagram for $A\cap B$](/_data/2401121104-2.png)

E.g.: Considering two sets:

$$
A=\{1,5,9,3\}
$$

$$
B=\{5,9,8\}
$$

Then, $A\cap B=\{5,9\}$

## Symmetric difference

Symmetric difference between two sets $A$ and $B$ is defined by the set of all elements that belong to $A$ or $B$, but not to both. It is denoted by $A\bigoplus B$.

_Figure 3: Venn diagram for $A\bigoplus B$:_

![Figure 3: Venn diagram for $A\bigoplus B$](/_data/2401121104-3.png)

E.g.: Considering $A=\{1,5,9,3\}$ and, $B=\{5,9,8\}$. Then, $A\bigoplus B=\{1,3,8\}$

#### Example 3: If $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$, and $B=\{1,3,5,7,11\}$. Then prove that $A\bigoplus B=(A-B)\cup(B-A)$.

$$
\textnormal{LHS}=A\bigoplus B=\{2,4,5,7,11\}
$$

$$
\textnormal{RHS}=(A-B)\cup(B-A)\\=\{2,4\}\cup\{5,7,11\}\\=\{2,4,5,7,11\}
$$

$$
\therefore A\bigoplus B=(A-B)\cup(B-A)
$$

$\therefore \textnormal{LHS}=\textnormal{RHS}$, hence proved.

# Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion

Let us suppose there are two sets $A$ and $B$, and they share elements between each other. If we want to find the total no. of elements in $A$ and $B$, without repeating any common element, then the principle of inclusion and exclusion states the following:

$$
|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|
$$

The number of elements of $A$ is added with all elements in $B$. The sum is then subtracted from the common elements in $A$ and $B$, which was added twice.

## Principle of inclusion and exclusion of three variables

Let the three sets be $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Then,

$$
|A\cup B\cup C|=|A\cup(B\cup C)|\\
=|A|+|B\cup C|-|A\cap(B\cup C)|\\
$$

By distributive law, we know that $A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$. Therefore,

$$
=|A|+|B|+|C|-|B\cap C|-|(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)|\\
=|A|+|B|+|C|-|B\cap C|-\{|A\cap B|+|A\cap C|-|A\cap B\cap A\cap C|\}\\
$$

Since, $A\cap A=A$, therefore:

$$
=|A|+|B|+|C|-|B\cap C|-\{|A\cap B|+|A\cap C|-|A\cap B\cap C|\}\\
=|A|+|B|+|C|-|B\cap C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|
$$

Therefore,

$$
(A\cup B\cup C)=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C|-|B\cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|
$$
