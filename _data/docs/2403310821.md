# Graph

A linear graph or simply a graph $G=(v,e)$, consists of a set of objects, $V=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots\}$ called vertices, and another set $E=\{e_1,e_2,e_3,\ldots\}$ called edges such that each edge, $e_k$, is identified with unordered pair of vertices.

Following is an example of a simple graph:

![Example of a simple graph](/_data/2403310821-1.png)

In the above example, the vertices set is: $V=\{A,B,C,D\}$, and the edges set is: $E=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

# Some Terms in Graph Theory

Following are some terms widely used in graph theory:

## Self loop

An edge having the same vertex as both its end vertices is called a self loop.

Following is an example:

![Example of self loop](/_data/2403310821-2.png)

In the above example, edge 1 is a normal edge and edge 2 is a self loop with the same end vertices.

## Parallel edges

If more than one edge is associated with a given pair og vertices, such edges are referred to as parallel edges.

Given below is an example of a graph showing parallel edges:

![Example of parallel edges](/_data/2403310821-3.png)

In the above example, edges 3 and 4 are examples of parallel edges.

## Finite and infinite graph

If in a graph the number of vertices and edges are finite then it is called a finite graph otherwise it is called an infinite graph.

| Type     | Graph                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Finite   | ![Example of finite graph](/_data/2403310821-4.png)   |
| Infinite | ![Example of infinite graph](/_data/2403310821-5.png) |

## Incidence

When a vertex $v_i$ is an end vertex of same edge $E_j$, then $v_i$ and $E_j$ are said to be incident with each other.

In the following example, 3 is incident on B and C.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-6.png)

## Adjacency

Two **non-parallel** edges are said to be adjacent if they are incident on a common vertex.

![Example of adjacency](/_data/2403310821-7.png)

In the above example, 3&5 are non-adjacent due to a parallel edge between them. Other than that, all other edge pairs are adjacent to each other.

## Degree of a vertex

The no. of edges incident on a vertex $v_i$ with self loop counted twice is called the degree $d(v_i)$ of a vertex.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-6.png)

In the above example, following are the degrees:

- $d(A)=2$
- $d(B)=2$
- $d(C)=2$
- $d(D)=1$

## Isolated vertex

A vertex having no incident edge is called an isolated vertex. In the following example, C is an isolated vertex.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-8.png)

## Pendant vertex

A vertex of degree 1 is called a pendant vertex or end vertex.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-6.png)

In the above example D is a pendant vertex.

## Regular graph

A graph in which all the vertices are of equal degree is called a regular graph. Following is an example of a regular graph:

![Example of a regular graph](/_data/2403310821-4.png)

# Theorem 1

> The number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even.

Let us consider vertices with odd degree and even degree seperately. Then, the total number of degrees in a graph can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}{d(v_i)}=\sum_{\textnormal{even}}{d(v_j)}+\sum_{\textnormal{odd}}d(v_k)
\end{align}
$$

We know, the total degree of a graph can be obtained by the number of edges ($2\times\textnormal{edges}$). Therefore equation $(1)$ can be written as:

$$
\begin{align}
    2\times e=\sum_{even}{d(v_j)}+\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}
\end{align}
$$

Where, $e$ is the number of edges.

The first expression on the right hand side is even, (being the sum of even numbers). The left hand side is also the sum of even degrees, which is also even. Thus equation $(2)$ can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \ &\textnormal{even}=\textnormal{even}+\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}\\
    \Rightarrow\ &\textnormal{even}-\textnormal{even}=\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}\\
    \Rightarrow\ &\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}=\textnormal{even}
\end{align*}
$$

The subtraction of one even number from another even number results in an even number. Therefore the theorem that, _the number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even_, holds true.

# Isomorphism

Two graphs $G$ and $G'$ are said to be isomorphic if there is _one-to-one_ correspondence between their vertices and their edges such that incidence relationship is maintained.

Thus for two isomorphic graph, it must have:

1. Same number of vertices
2. Same number of edges
3. An equal number of vertices with a given degree

In the following examples, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic graphs:

| Label | Graph                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| $G_1$ | ![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| $G_2$ | ![G2](/_data/2403310821-10.png) |

#### Example 1: _"The criteria for isomorphism in the definition is insufficient."_ Justify this with an example.

Considering two graphs:

![Example 1](/_data/2403310821-11.png)

Graph having vertices set, $V_1=\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$ be named $G$, and $V_2=\{Q,R,S,T,U,V\}$ be named $G'$.

According to the formal definition, both $G$ and $G'$ are isomorphic because:

1. They have equal number of vertices
2. They have equal number of edges
3. They have equal number of vertices with a given degree

The vertex $D$ in $G$ must correspond to the vertex $S$ in $G'$, as both their degree is 3. $W$ is associated with two pendant vertex whereas $S$ is associated with one pendant vertex, thus $G$ and $G'$ are not really isomorphic.

# Sub-graph

A graph $g$ is said to be a subgraph of a graph $G$, if all the vertices and all the edges of $g$ are in $G$ and each edge of $g$ has the same end vertex in $G$.

For example, in the following, $g$ is a subgraph of $G$:

| Label           | Graph                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $G$             | ![G](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| $g$ (sub-graph) | ![g](/_data/2403310821-12.png) |

### Characteristics of sub-graph

- Every graph is its own sub-graph
- A sub-graph of a sub-graph of $G$ is also a sub-graph of $G$
- A single vertex of $G$ is also a sub-graph of $G$
- A single edge of $G$ along with its end vertices is also a sub-graph of $G$.

# Operations on Graphs

## Union

The union of two graphs, $G_1=(v_1,e_1)$, and $G_2=(v_2,e_2)$ is anothe graph, $G_3=(v_3,e_3)$, whose vertex set $v_3=v_1\cup v_2$, and edge set is $e_3=e_1\cup e_2$.

Following is the example of graphical union:

| Label             | Graph                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $G_1$             | ![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| $G_2$             | ![G2](/_data/2403310821-13.png) |
| $G_3=G_1\cup G_2$ | ![G3](/_data/2403310821-14.png) |

## Intersection

The intersection of two graphs $G_1=(v_1,e_1)$ and $G_2=(v_2,e_2)$, is another graph $G_3=(v_3,e_3)$, whose vertex set, $v_3=v_1\cap v_2$, and edge set is, $e_3=e_1\cap e_2$.

Following is the example of graphical intersection:

| Label             | Graph                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $G_1$             | ![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| $G_2$             | ![G2](/_data/2403310821-13.png) |
| $G_3=G_1\cap G_2$ | ![G3](/_data/2403310821-15.png) |

# Ring sum

The ring sum of two graphs $G_1=(v_1,e_1)$, and $G_2=(v_2,e_2)$, is another graph $G_3=(v_3,e_3)$, written as $G_3=G_1\oplus G_2$ whose vertex set $v_3=v_1\cup v2$, and edge set having those edges that are either in $G_1$ or in $G_2$ but not in both.

| Label               | Graph                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $G_1$               | ![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| $G_2$               | ![G2](/_data/2403310821-13.png) |
| $G_3=G_1\oplus G_2$ | ![G3](/_data/2403310821-16.png) |

# Fusion

A pair of vertices $(a,b)$ in a graph are said to be fused if the two vertices are replaced by a single new vertex such that every edge that was incident on either $a$ or $b$ or both are now incident on the new vertex.

Considering the following graph:

![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)

In the above graph when $B$ and $D$ are fused, we get the following, where edge 6 forms a self-loop and edge 2 and 4 are parallel.

![G3](/_data/2403310821-17.png)

## Decomposition

A graph $G$ is said to have been decomposed into two sub-graphs $g_1$ and $g_2$ such that:

$$
g_1\cup g_2=G;\\
g_1\cap g_2=\text{Null}
$$

Example:

| Label           | Graph                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $G$             | ![G1](/_data/2403310821-9.png)  |
| Decomposed part | ![G3](/_data/2403310821-18.png) |
| Final graph     | ![G3](/_data/2403310821-19.png) |

# Matrix Representation of a Graph

## Incidence matrix

Let $G$ be a graph, with $n$ vertices, $e$ edges, and no self loops, then incidence matrix is an $n\times e$ matrix, $A=[a_{ij}]$, whose $n$ rows corresponds to $n$ vertices, and $e$ columns correspond to $e$ edges.

The following holds true:

- $a_{ij}=1$, if $j^{\text{th}}$ edge is incident on $i^{\text{th}}$ vertex
- $a_{ij}=0$, otherwise

Considering the following example:

![G](/public/_data/2403310821-20.png)

Incidence matrix of the above graph:

$$
\begin{matrix}
     &&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\
     \\
    A&&1&0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\
    B&&1&1&0&1&0&1&0&0\\
    C&&0&1&1&0&0&0&0&0\\
    D&&0&0&1&1&1&0&0&0\\
    E&&0&0&0&0&1&1&1&1\\
    F&&0&0&0&0&0&0&1&1\\
\end{matrix}
$$

### Characteristics

1. The number of 1s in a row gives the degree of the corresponding matrix.
2. Every edge is on exactly two vertices, hence every column has exactly two 1s.
3. A row with all 0s corresponds to an isolated vertex.
4. A column of single 1s would represent a self loop.
5. Two identical columns represent parallel edges.

## Adjacency matrix

The adjacency matrix of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and no parallel edges is an $n\times n$ matrix $X=[a_{ij}]$, whose elements:

- $x_{ij}=1$, if there is an edge between $i^{\text{th}}$ and $j^{\text{th}}$ vertex
- $x_{ij}=0$, otherwise

Considering the following example:

![G](/public/_data/2403310821-21.png)

Adjacency matrix of the above graph is:

$$
\begin{matrix}
     &&A&B&C&D&E&F\\\\
    A&&0&1&0&0&0&0\\
    B&&1&0&1&1&1&0\\
    C&&0&1&0&1&0&0\\
    D&&0&1&1&0&1&0\\
    E&&0&1&1&0&0&1\\
    F&&0&0&0&0&1&0\\
\end{matrix}
$$

### Characteristics

1. The diagonal elements are zero if there are no self loop.
2. The number of 1s in a row or column gives the degree of that vertex.
3. There are no provision for parallel edges because that information cannot be stored in the matrix.
4. A row or column of all 0s correspond to an isolated matrix.
5. A matrix of all zeros represent a **null graph**.

#### Example 2: Draw a graph corresponding to the following matrix:

$$
\begin{matrix}
     &&A&B&C&D&E\\\\
    A&&0&1&0&0&0\\
    B&&1&0&1&1&0\\
    C&&0&0&0&0&0\\
    D&&0&1&0&0&0\\
    E&&0&1&0&0&0\\
\end{matrix}
$$

The graph represented by the above matrix is:

![G](/public/_data/2403310821-22.png)

## Circuit matrix

Let the number of different circuits in a graph $G$ be $q$ and the number of edges in $G$ be $e$, then the circuit matrix $B=[b_{ij}]$ is a $q\times e$ matrix whose elements are:

- $b_{ij}=1$, if the $i^{\text{th}}$ circuit includes $j^{\text{th}}$ edge
- $b_{ij}=0$, otherwise

Considering the following example of a graph:

![G](/public/_data/2403310821-20.png)

The above represented in circuit matrix will be:

$$
\begin{matrix}
       &&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\\\
    C_1&&0&1&1&1&0&0&0&0\\
    C_2&&0&0&0&1&1&1&0&0\\
    C_3&&0&1&1&0&1&1&0&0\\
    C_4&&0&0&0&0&0&0&1&1\\
\end{matrix}
$$

### Characteristics

1. The number of 1s in a row denotes the number of edges participating in the circuit.
2. A column of all zeros denotes an edge which is not part of any circuit.
3. A single 1 in a row denotes a self loop.
4. Two graphs $G_1$, and $G_2$ are isomorphic if they have the same circuit matrix.
5. A column of all 1s denotes an edge which is a part of all circuits.

## Path matrix

A path matrix for a specific pair of vertices say $(x,y)$, and is written as $p(x,y)=[p_{ij}]$, where the number of rows denotes the different available paths between $x$ and $y$, and columns represent the edges.

- $p_{ij}=1$, if $j^{\text{th}}$ edge lies in $i^{\text{th}}$ path
- $p_{ij}=0$, otherwise

> The same vertex cannot be travelled twice.

Considering the example for a following graph:

![G](/public/_data/2403310821-20.png)

The path matrix between $A$ and $D$ is:

$$
\begin{matrix}
       &&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\\\
    P_1&&1&0&0&0&1&1&0&0\\
    P_2&&1&1&1&0&0&0&0&0\\
    P_3&&1&0&0&1&0&0&0&0\\
\end{matrix}
$$

### Characteistics

1. A column of all zeros, represents an edge which is not a part of any edge of the paths.
2. A column of all 1s represent an edge which is a part of all the paths.
3. The number of 1s in a row give the path length.
4. It only works for two given vertices.
5. Path matrix cannot be attained if both vertices source and destination are the same.
