# Graph

A linear graph or simply a graph $G=(v,e)$, consists of a set of objects, $V=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots\}$ called vertices, and another set $E=\{e_1,e_2,e_3,\ldots\}$ called edges such that each edge, $e_k$, is identified with unordered pair of vertices.

Following is an example of a simple graph:

In the above example, the vertices set is: $V=\{A,B,C,D\}$, and the edges set is: $E=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

# Some Terms in Graph Theory

Following are some terms widely used in graph theory:

## Self loop

An edge having the same vertex as both its end vertices is called a self loop.

Following is an example:

![Example of self loop](/_data/2403310821-2.png)

In the above example, edge 1 is a normal edge and edge 2 is a self loop with the same end vertices.

## Parallel edges

If more than one edge is associated with a given pair og vertices, such edges are referred to as parallel edges.

Given below is an example of a graph showing parallel edges:

In the above example, edges 3 and 4 are examples of parallel edges.

## Finite and infinite graph

If in a graph the number of vertices and edges are finite then it is called a finite graph otherwise it is called an infinite graph.

| Type     | Graph                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Finite   | ![Example of finite graph](/_data/2403310821-4.png)   |
| Infinite | ![Example of infinite graph](/_data/2403310821-5.png) |

## Incidence

When a vertex $v_i$ is an end vertex of same edge $E_j$, then $v_i$ and $E_j$ are said to be incident with each other.

In the following example, 3 is incident on B and C.

## Adjacency

Two **non-parallel** edges are said to be adjacent if they are incident on a common vertex.

![Example of adjacency](/_data/2403310821-7.png)

In the above example, 3&5 are non-adjacent due to a parallel edge between them. Other than that, all other edge pairs are adjacent to each other.

## Degree of a vertex

The no. of edges incident on a vertex $v_i$ with self loop counted twice is called the degree $d(v_i)$ of a vertex.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-6.png)

In the above example, following are the degrees:

- $d(A)=2$
- $d(B)=2$
- $d(C)=2$
- $d(D)=1$

## Isolated vertex

A vertex having no incident edge is called an isolated vertex. In the following example, C is an isolated vertex.

## Pendant vertex

A vertex of degree 1 is called a pendant vertex or end vertex.

![Example of incidence](/_data/2403310821-6.png)

In the above example D is a pendant vertex.

## Regular graph

A graph in which all the vertices are of equal degree is called a regular graph. Following is an example of a regular graph:

# Theorem 1

> The number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even.

Let us consider vertices with odd degree and even degree seperately. Then, the total number of degrees in a graph can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}{d(v_i)}=\sum_{\textnormal{even}}{d(v_j)}+\sum_{\textnormal{odd}}d(v_k)
\end{align}
$$

We know, the total degree of a graph can be obtained by the number of edges ($2\times\textnormal{edges}$). Therefore equation $(1)$ can be written as:

$$
\begin{align}
    2\times e=\sum_{even}{d(v_j)}+\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}
\end{align}
$$

Where, $e$ is the number of edges.

The first expression on the right hand side is even, (being the sum of even numbers). The left hand side is also the sum of even degrees, which is also even. Thus equation $(2)$ can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \ &\textnormal{even}=\textnormal{even}+\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}\\
    \Rightarrow\ &\textnormal{even}-\textnormal{even}=\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}\\
    \Rightarrow\ &\sum_{odd}{d(v_k)}=\textnormal{even}
\end{align*}
$$

The subtraction of one even number from another even number results in an even number. Therefore the theorem that, _the number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even_, holds true.
