The term _digital_ in digital circuits is derived from the way circuits perform operations by counting digits. A digital circuit operates with binary numbers, i.e., only in two states. The outputs of the circuit is either low $0$ or high $1$ in a **positive logic system**. In general, $0$ represents zero volts and $1$ represents five volts. If the situation is in reverse, it is known as **negative logic system**.

# Number System

The decimal number system $(0,1,2,3\ldots 9)$, is commonly used even though there are many other number systems like binary, octal and hexadecimal, etc. It is possible to express a number in any base or radix $x$. In the binary system, the base is $2$. In general, any number system with radix, $x$, having $m$ digits to the left, and $n$ digits to the right of the decimal point can be expressed as:

$$
a_mx^{m-1}+a_{m-1}x^{m-2}+\ldots+a_2x^1+a_1x^0\ .\ b_1x^{-1}+b_2x^{-2}+\ldots+b_nx^{-n}
$$

# Number Conversions

## Decimal to binary conversion

Decimal to binary conversion can be perfomed using the divisor-remainder method, by dividing the decimal number with 2 progressively, until 0 is achieved as a quotient. Further, all the remainder after each division is written in a reverse order, which forms the binary number.

#### Example 1: Convert decimal number `41` to binary equivalent.

Divisor-remainder method:

```
2[41]
2[20]-----1
2[10]-----0
2[5]------0
2[2]------1
2[1]------0
 [0]------1
```

Therefore the binary equivalent is: `101001`.

In case of numbers with decimal point, the part beyond the decimal point is multiplied with 2 untill a loop is achieved. The part of the result before the decimal point, is the binary part, and the part after is then multiplied with two and the process is repeated until a loop is achieved.

#### Example 2: Convert `41.56` from decimal to binary.

For the part before the decimal: `41`

```
2[41]
2[20]-----1
2[10]-----0
2[5]------0
2[2]------1
2[1]------0
 [0]------1
```

The binary equivalent for before the decimal point is: `101001`.

For the part after the decimal, `0.56`, we have:

```
(0.56)2=1.12-----1
(0.12)2=0.24-----0
(0.24)2=0.48-----0
(0.48)2=0.96-----0
(0.96)2=1.92-----1
```

The binary equivalent for the part after the decimal is: `10001`.

Therefore the binary equivalent for `41.56` is: `101001.10001`.

## Binary to decimal conversions

The binary number is first numbered starting from zero from right to left, fashion. Then binary digit is multiplied with 2 raised to the power of the position. Lets say, the binary is $b$, and the position is $n$, then the value at that position is:

$$
V=b\times 2^n
$$

#### Example 3: Convert `110010` from binary to decimal.

Firstly numbering the binary number:

```
Pos:  5   4   3   2   1   0
Num:  1   1   0   0   1   0
```

Therefore, the decimal equivalent is:

$$
\begin{align*}
D_e&=1.2^5+1.2^4+0.2^3+0.2^2+1.2^1+0.2^0\\
&=32+16+0+0+2+0\\
&=50
\end{align*}
$$

> **Octal number system**, is a base 8 number system, which has numbers from $0,1,2\ldots7$.
>
> **Hexadecimal number system**, is a base 16 number system, consisting of both numbers and digits, $0,1,\ldots9$, and $A,B,\ldots F$.

Just like binary, other number systems have the same conversion relations with decimal numbers. When converting from decimal, the divisor-remainder method is used, with the divisor being the base of the required number system. When converting to decimal, the positional number, is multiplied with base raised to the power of position.

# Exercise 1

1. Perform the following conversions:
   1. `224` [from base 10 to base 16]
   2. `B2D.F6` [from base 16 to base 10]
   3. `4C2.E6` [from base 16 to base 2]
   4. `10110.10110` [from base 2 to base 16]
2. Convert `4447` from octal to hexadecimal using the divisor-remainder method.

#### Example 4: Given a relation, $(244)_8=(301)_x$. Find the value of base $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(224)_8&=(301)_x\\
\implies 2.8^2+2.8^1+4.8^0&=3.x^2+0.x^1+1.x^0\\
\implies 148&=3x^2+1\\
\implies 3x^2&=147\implies x=\pm 7
\end{aligned}
$$

Since, base cannot be $-7$, therefore the base is $7$.

## Binary addition

Following is the chart for binary addition:

| First number | Second number | Result         |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| 0            | 0             | 0              |
| 0            | 1             | 1              |
| 1            | 0             | 1              |
| 1            | 1             | 10 (0 carry 1) |

#### Example 5: Add the following numbers: $(26)_2+(22)_2$.

`26` in binary is: `11010`, `22` in binary is: `10110`.

```
    1 1   1   1
      1   1   0   1   0
    + 1   0   1   1   0
    -------------------
    1 1   0   0   0   0
```

Therefore, the binary equivalent for the result is: `110000`.

## Binary subtraction

Following is the chart for binary subtraction:

| First number | Second number | Result     |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| 0            | 0             | 0          |
| 0            | 1             | 1 borrow 1 |
| 1            | 0             | 1          |
| 1            | 1             | 0          |

#### Example 6: Subtract `10110` from `11010`.

```

      1   1   0   1   0
    + 1   0+1 1   1   0
    -------------------
      0   0   1   0   0
```

Therefore the binary equivalent for the result is: `100`.
